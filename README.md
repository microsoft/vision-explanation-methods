# vision-explanation-methods 

Vision Explanation Methods is an open-source package that implements D-RISE ([Detector Randomized Input Sampling for Explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03204)) towards visual interpretations of object detection models.
D-RISE is a black-boxed, or model-agnostic, explainability method which can produce saliency maps for any object detection or instance segmentation models provided these models are appropriately wrapped. In essence, D-RISE works by randomly masking the input images and isolating the parts that are most pertinent for the detection or segmentation of the object in question.

## Installation

To install the vision explanation package, run:
```
pip install vision-explanation-package
```

## Colab

The process of fine-tuning an object detection model and visualizing it through D-RISE is illustrated in this [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RRJytXf-yBlD_KSOQ0k3TpHItgs56I5q?usp=sharing).

## Basic Usage

To generate saliency maps, import the package and run:
```
res = DRISE_runner.get_drise_saliency_map(
    imagelocation: str,
    model: Optional[object],
    modellocation: Optional[str],
    numclasses: int,
    savename: str,
    nummasks: int=25,
    maskres: Tuple[int, int]=(4,4),
    maskpadding: Optional[int]=None,
    devicechoice: Optional[str]=None,
    wrapperchoice: Optional[object] = PytorchFasterRCNNWrapper
    )
```
